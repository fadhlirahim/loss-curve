## Your Task

Clean up stale local branches that have been deleted from the remote.

1. **List branches** to identify any with `[gone]` status:

```bash
git fetch --prune && git branch -v
```

2. **List worktrees** that may need removal:

```bash
git worktree list
```

3. **Remove worktrees and delete `[gone]` branches**:

```bash
git branch -v | grep '\[gone\]' | sed 's/^[+* ]//' | awk '{print $1}' | while read branch; do
  echo "Processing branch: $branch"
  worktree=$(git worktree list | grep "\\[$branch\\]" | awk '{print $1}')
  if [ ! -z "$worktree" ] && [ "$worktree" != "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" ]; then
    echo "  Removing worktree: $worktree"
    git worktree remove --force "$worktree"
  fi
  echo "  Deleting branch: $branch"
  git branch -D "$branch"
done
```

4. Report which branches and worktrees were removed, or that no cleanup was needed.
